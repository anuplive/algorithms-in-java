Verify if you are on right Track
1. Requirements ->

2. Non functional :
   Scaling, Loadbalancing, Partitioning/ Sharding, Caching, CAP cosideration
   Read/Write Ratio
   Band Width Estimation
   Request Response Estimation

3. System Interface
   API Design, Contract that the Applications need to follow

4. Defining the Data Model:
   What type of Data base should we use NoSQL or Relational DB
   Mongo DB(DocumentDb ), Cassandra(Columnar DB ) Sparse Data, Redis(Name Value), Graph DB.

5.HLD
Client -> Load Balancer(Gate Way service) -> JMS / REST-API -> Storage/DB

6. Detailed Design

7. Identify the Bottle Necks
   Single Point of failure in the System
   Do we have enough copies of Data
   Do we have enough copies of Services
   Do we have metrics that will Capture the performance and alert in case of issues.
